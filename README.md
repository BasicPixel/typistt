## about

typistt is a simple typing test / typing practice website, inspired by monkeytype.com

words mode uses the 200 most common english words by default or gets random words from an api, while quote mode gets a random quote from quotable.

## abbreviations

wpm = words per minute
cpm = characters per minute
acc = accuracy

## hotkeys

tab: restart test
esc: reshuffle words (words mode)
note: typistt does not yet support ctrl+enter to delete a whole world (adding later)
